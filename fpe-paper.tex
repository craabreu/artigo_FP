		\begin{abstract}
Solvation free energies can be essential in the process of evaluating and developing force fields. In addition, they can be used to obtain a diversity of other thermodynamic properties such as Henry's law constants and partition coefficients, for instance. In this paper, we study the solvation of asphaltene-like molecules (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) in both aqueous and organic solvents by using a coarse-grained model known as the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field. This model relies on a top-down approach in which the force-field parameters are obtained using an equation of state. The use of solvation free energy calculations to evaluate this force field can help in improving the model and increasing the scale in which these simulations can be applied. The results presented here were obtained by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations, with the expanded ensemble method being applied to sample an alchemical path. For this, we employed a softcore variant of the Mie potential. From the output of these simulations, we estimated free-energy differences by means of the MBAR method. The results with organic solvents exhibited low absolute deviations from experimental data. In turn, hydration free energy calculations required a binary interaction parameter to be estimated from molecular dynamics data, which displays a flaw in the top-down parameterization approach. Fortunately, however, a single binary parameter could be used for all pairs of polyaromatic hydrocarbons with water, proving that the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field exhibits a suitable transferability property that deserves further investigation.

	\section{Introduction}

	Solvation free energy calculations with molecular dynamics (MD) have a variety of applications ranging from drug design in the pharmaceutical industry to the development of separation technologies in the chemical industry. {Solvation free energy is, more specifically, the difference in free energy related to the process of transferring a solute from an ideal gas phase into a liquid solution \cite{shirts2013}}. Through the study of the solvation phenomenon, it is possible to obtain information about the behavior of a solvent in different thermodynamic conditions and the influence of the solute's molecular geometry. It is also possible to calculate other important properties from the solvation free energy, namely activity coefficients, Henry's law constants, and partition coefficients. Additionally, solvation free energy calculations can be part of a methodology to calculate solubility from molecular dynamics.
	
	The solvation free energy calculations described above are intrinsically complex due to the many competing forces that interfere in the behavior of the solute-solvent interaction. Also, free-energy simulations are susceptible to sampling problems in low-energy regions, and simulation results need to be correctly post-processed in order to yield free-energy differences with known uncertainties. Various simulation methodologies were developed to enable estimation of free energy differences, such as the expanded ensemble \cite{lyubartsev}, thermodynamic integration \cite{kirkwood1935}, free energy perturbation (FEP) \cite{zwanzig1954,bennet1976,mbar}, and umbrella sampling \cite{TORRIE1977187}. By employing FEP-based methodologies, a group of researchers have recently made available a large database of hydration free energies of small molecules using the GAFF force field \cite{PMID:24928188,mobley2017}. Beckstein \textit{et al}. \cite{Beckstein2014} also calculated the hydration free energies for fifty-two compounds with the OPLS-AA force field. They obtained an overall root-mean-square deviation of 1.75 kcal/mol from experimental data. Izairi and Kamberaj \cite{izairi2017} studied hydration free energies as well, but with the intention of comparing polar and nonpolar contributions. Garrido \textit{et al}. \cite{garrido,garrido2011} calculated the free energy of solvation of large alkanes in 1-octanol and water with three different force fields (TraPPE, GROMOS, and OPLS-AA/TraPPE). These authors also estimated the solvation free energy of propane and benzene in non-aqueous solvents like n-hexadecane, n-hexane, ethylbenzene, and acetone with the TraPPE-UA and TraPPE-AA force fields. Roy \textit{et al}. \cite{roy2017} addressed the choice of the Lennard-Jones parameters for predicting solvation free energy of different solutes in 1-octanol. They calculated the solvation free energy of a set of 205 small organic molecules in 1-octanol and found that the force field parametrization of n-octanol proposed by Kobryn and Kovalenko \cite{doi:10.1063/1.2972978} provided the best agreement to the experimental data. Gon\c{c}alves and Stassen \cite{goncalves} calculated solvation free energies using a polarizable continuum model coupled to molecular dynamics simulation with the GROMOS force field. These calculations were done with a representative set of solutes and with the solvents tetrachloride, chloroform, and benzene. Using GAFF and the polarizable AMOEBA \cite{doi:10.1021/ja037005r} force field, Mohamed \textit{et al}. \cite{mohamed2016} evaluated the solvation free energy of small molecules in toluene, chloroform, and acetonitrile, and obtained a mean absolute error of 1.22 kcal/mol for AMOEBA and 0.66 kcal/mol for GAFF. Genheden \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00963} expanded the ELBA coarse-grained force field \cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0028637} to calculate solvation free energies of more than 150 solutes taken from the Minnesota solvation database \cite{Minnesota} in both polar (water, hexanol, octanol, and nonanol) and nonpolar (hexane, octane, and nonane) solvents. He obtained mean absolute deviations of 1 kcal/mol for water and 1.5 kcal/mol for hexane. In this model, three carbons are represented by a single bead and water is represented by a single bead with point-dipole.

	As it is clear in the previous paragraph, solvation free energy simulation is performed in the literature using a variety of force fields. This is so because the choice of force field is an essential influencing factor in the output of these calculations. Within this context, in the present study we assess the benefits and shortcomings in using the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie coarse-grained force field \cite{avendano2011} in solvation free energy calculations for a variety of solute-solvent pairs. Our choice for a coarse-grained force field is justified by the ability of this kind of model to reproduce free-energy differences since the suppression of degrees of freedom and its effect on the entropy can be compensated by the subtraction of energy terms \cite{kmiecik2016}. This fact makes these models a viable option to decrease the computational cost of solvation-free energy calculations. Additionally, deficiencies in the description of small molecules by coarse-grained models can be revealed by free energy calculations \cite{mobley2007,shirts2013}. We specifically selected the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field because its associated method of obtaining parameters is more straightforward than those for other coarse-grained models. The SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field was initially parameterized with pure-substance equilibrium and interfacial tension data \cite{avendano2011}, and this strategy has provided satisfactory results. Examples include the prediction of phase equilibrium of aromatic compounds \cite{muller2017}, alkanes, light gases \cite{herdes2015}, and water \cite{lobanova2015}, thermodynamic and transport properties of carbon dioxide and methane \cite{cassiano1, cassiano2, cassiano3}, multiphase equilibrium of mixtures of water, carbon dioxide, and n-alkanes \cite{lobanova2016}, and water/oil interfacial tension \cite{herdes2017}.
	
	We selected solvents and solutes with the intention of testing the force field with standard sets used as a benchmarks for solvation free energy calculations, but also having in mind their potential applications in the study of asphaltene behavior. Asphaltenes are complicated to characterize by determining their composition on a molecular basis, but in the literature it is broadly accepted that they can be described as a fraction of crude oil that is soluble in toluene and insoluble in n-alkanes (pentane, hexane, heptane) \cite{SJOBLOM2003399}. They have motivated many studies with interest in developing models for their structure and behavior due to all the problems they can cause by precipitating during the transportation and processing of oil \cite{SJOBLOM20151}. This is a recurrent problem due to the growing market of the production of crude oil in deep waters, whose conditions are favorable to precipitation \cite{AIC:AIC10243}. As an example, asphaltene precipitation due to pressure drop can clog oil production equipment and cause a increase in the cost of production \cite{doi:10.1021/ef010047l}. All these factors make the understanding of the behavior of asphaltenes in different chemical and physical environments relevant to the oil industry. Due to the mentioned issues still present in the characterization of asphaltenes, we chose to use simple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with well-defined characteristics, to initially test the efficiency of the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field in describing the solvation phenomenon. PAHs are a group of organic compounds that have fused rings in their structure \cite{RAVINDRA20082895}. The ones adopted in this work are phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene because they share similarities with asphaltenes regarding solubility. In this context, we selected compounds that are used to characterize asphaltenes (toluene, hexane) as solvents in our free energy calculations. We have also carried out simulations using water as a solvent (due to its extensive use in solvation free energy studies) and tested the solvent/anti-solvent effect of carbon dioxide due to its influence in asphaltene precipitation during oil processing \cite{SOROUSH2014405}. With these calculations of solvation free energies with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model, we intend to improve this force field and provide satisfactory solvation free energy estimates of PAHs with a coarse-grained model. The success of the description of small asphaltene-like compounds by this force field can then open up the possibility of obtaining suitable results for more complex asphaltene models using a force field with a low computational cost.

	\section{Computational Methods}
	
	\subsection{SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie Force Field}

	The SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field uses a top-down coarse-graining methodology in its parameterization. It aims at obtaining the intermolecular parameters from macroscopic experimental data such as fluid-phase equilibrium or interfacial tension data. The idea is that the force field parameters estimated with the SAFT-VR Mie EoS \cite{lafitte2013} can be used in molecular simulations, since both the equation of state and the force field use the Mie potential as the non-bonded interaction model. Such potential is given by
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:miepotential}
	U_\text{Mie}(r) = C \epsilon  \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{\lambda_r} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{\lambda_a} \right],
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
	C = \frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a} \left(\frac{\lambda_r}{\lambda_a} \right)^{\left( \frac{\lambda_a}{\lambda_r - \lambda_a} \right)}.
	\end{equation*}

	In this model, $\epsilon$ is the potential well depth, $\sigma$ is the segment diameter, $r$ is the distance between two segments, $\lambda_r$ is the repulsive exponent, and $\lambda_a$ is the attractive exponent. Using the Mie potential instead of the more common Lennard-Jones model (which is a special case with $\lambda_r = 12$ and $\lambda_a = 6$) provides this force field with an advantageous flexibility \cite{herdes2015}. In addition, the possibility of using an equation of state in the parameter-fitting stage enables the exploration of a vast parameter space without using an iterative simulation scheme \cite{avendano2011}. Despite these advantages, the force field can be restricted by the shortcomings of the underlying equation of state. For instance, the lack of an association term can cause an inadequate representation of the properties of hydrogen-bonding compounds.

	For a substance whose molecule is modeled as a string of segments, one has initially five parameters to estimate, namely $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, $\lambda_r$, $\lambda_a$, and the number of segments $m_s$. The latter is usually fixed in an integer value so as to allow its use in molecular simulations. The attractive parameter is also generally fixed due to its high correlation with the repulsive parameter. The chosen value is usually $6$, corresponding to the London model, which is a good representation of the dispersion scale of most simple fluids with no strong polar interactions \cite{ramrattan2015,herdes2015}. There are two strategies to obtain these parameters: one is by fitting the SAFT-VR Mie EoS to experimental data such as vapor pressure and liquid density \cite{avendano2013}, and the other one is by using corresponding states parametrization \cite{mejia2014}. Here, the first strategy was used to find the parameters for phenanthrene from vapor pressure data \cite{murphy,osborn} by following the methodology proposed by M\"{u}ller and Mej\'{i}a \cite{muller2017}. The parameterization was carried out with the number of segments fixed to five and with a geometry such as that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fen5}. This level of coarse-graining was also used for a similar molecule (anthracene) in the original paper. We also show in Fig.~\ref{fig:edefit} the vapor pressure curve obtained by using the SAFT-VR Mie EoS with the parameters estimated here.

The curve is a result of calculations using the SAFT-VR Mie EoS with the geometry of Fiq.~\ref{fig:fen5} ($m_s = 5$), the London attractive exponent ($\lambda_a = 6$), and the remaining parameters estimated from those data ($\epsilon/k_b = 262.74 K$, $\sigma = 4.077 \AA$, and $\lambda_r = 9.55$).}
		\label{fig:edefit}
	\end{figure}

	The parameters for the other compounds were retrieved from the literature, and all these parameters are displayed in Table~\ref{tbl:parameters}. The use of combining rules is necessary only when modeling a mixture with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field, since each molecule is composed of equal segments. The mixing rules employed for this force field are \cite{lafitte2013}
	\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{ij} =\frac{\sigma_i+\sigma_j}{2},
	\label{eqn:sigmamix}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	\lambda_{k_{ij}} = 3 + \sqrt{(\lambda_{k_i}-3)(\lambda_{k_j}-3)}, \quad k=r,a, \quad \text{and}
	\label{eqn:lambdamix}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:epsmix}
	\epsilon_{ij} =(1-k_{ij})\frac{\sqrt{\sigma_i^3\sigma_j^3}}{\sigma_{ij}^3}\sqrt{\epsilon_i\epsilon_j}.
	\end{equation}
	
	These mixing rules are available in the literature and have been employed in other papers in which this force field was used. In Eq.~\eqref{eqn:epsmix}, $k_{ij}$ is a binary interaction parameter. This parameter accounts for the interactions among chemically distinct compounds, which are not explicitly considered by the SAFT-VR Mie EoS. In our study, the binary interaction parameter was only necessary for aqueous mixtures.

		\end{tabular}
		
	\end{table}

	\subsection{Expanded Ensemble}
	\label{sec:expanded ensemble}

	The strategy chosen to calculate the solvation free energies was a gradual insertion of the solute molecule in the solvent using an alchemical thermodynamic path \cite{klimovich}. Each alchemical state is represented by the value of a coupling parameter, $\lambda$, which ranges from 0 to 1. When $\lambda=0$, there is no interaction with the solvent and, when $\lambda=1$, the interactions are fully activated. Since the force field used does not explicitly take charges in consideration, the interactions are only due to the Mie potential. For a partial coupling of the Mie potential, we propose a generalized softcore Mie equation based on the model of Beutler \textit{et al}. \cite{beutler}, which is
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:miesoftcore}
	\begin{aligned}
	U_{Mie}^{sc}(r) = \lambda C \epsilon \Bigg\lbrace & \frac{1}{\left[\alpha(1-\lambda)+ (r/\sigma)^{\lambda_a}\right]^{\lambda_{r}/\lambda_{a}}} \\ &-\frac{1}{\alpha(1-\lambda)+(r/\sigma)^{\lambda_a}} \Bigg\rbrace,
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha$ is a constant whose value is normally assumed to be 0.5. Instead of performing various simulations at different alchemical states to obtain the potential energies of Eq.~\eqref{eq:miesoftcore}, we decided to use the Expanded Ensemble method \cite{lyubartsev}, which allows a non-Boltzmann sampling of all states in a single simulation. In this scheme, the sampling is done by biasing the phase space exploration process with weights. The partition function of the expanded ensemble, $Z^{EE}$, is obtained from the probability distributions corresponding to each $\lambda$. It is defined as a weighted sum of subensemble partition functions for discrete values of $\lambda$, that is,
	\begin{equation}
	Z^{EE} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} Z_{i} \exp(\eta_{i}),
	\label{ee}
	\end{equation}
	where $N$ is the number of alchemical states, $\eta_i$ is the arbitrary weight of the subensemble at each state, and $Z_{i}$ is the configurational partition function of state $i$. Here, we followed the flat-histogram approach  to calculate the weights \cite{lyubartsev}. This strategy aims to obtain adequate sampling by ensuring that all the states have an equal number of visits, i.e. the probability of sampling state $i$ ($\pi_{i}$) is equal to that of sampling state $j$ ($\pi_{j}$). Using this relation, the following equation can be obtained:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:weight}
	\eta_{i} - \eta_{j} = \beta (G_i-G_j).
	\end{equation}
	
	Thus, the choice of weights is dependent on the very free energies we are trying to obtain. This equation is then solved iteratively with trial simulations. For the first simulation, the values of $\eta$ are set to zero, and a generally non-flat histogram of state visits is obtained. We then estimate the free energy differences with the MBAR method \cite{mbar} (see Sec.~\ref{mds}) and, from Eq.~\eqref{eqn:weight}, the next employed set of $\eta$ values are calculated. This iteration goes on until a uniform distribution is attained. The weights found are then used in a longer simulation to obtain the final solvation free energies.
	
	The choice of the $\lambda$ set corresponding to overlapping alchemical states are crucial to the computation of accurate free energy differences. In this work, the method chosen to obtain an optimal staging of the $\lambda$ domain is the one developed by Escobedo and Mart\'{i}nez-Veracoechea \cite{escobedo2007}, based on the study of Katzgraber \textit{et al}. \cite{1742-5468-2006-03-P03018}. This method targets bottlenecks in the simulation by maximizing the number of round trips per CPU time between the lowest ($0$) and highest ($1$) values of $\lambda$. The steady-state flow rate of the simulation, which ``walks'' through the values of $\lambda$, is estimated by a Fick-type diffusion law,
	\begin{equation}
	\phi = D(\Lambda) \Pi (\Lambda) \dfrac{dx(\Lambda)}{d \Lambda},
	\label{eqn:stream}
	\end{equation}
	where $\Lambda$ is the actual, continuous value of the coupling parameter, $D(\Lambda)$ is the diffusivity at state $\Lambda$, $\Pi(\Lambda)$ is the probability density function, and $x(\Lambda)$ is the fraction of times that a simulation, being at state $\Lambda$, has most recently visited the state $\Lambda=1$ as opposed to state $\Lambda=0$. The flow rate $\phi$ is maximized if the probability density $\Pi(\Lambda)$ is proportional to $[D(\Lambda)]^{-1/2}$ \cite{escobedo2007,1742-5468-2006-03-P03018}, where $D(\Lambda)$ can be estimated (up to an additive constant) from Eq.~\eqref{eqn:stream} via finite differences. The optimal $\lambda$ states are then obtained iteratively using the inverse of a cumulative probability $\Phi(\lambda) = \int_0^\lambda \Pi(\Lambda) d\Lambda$. A graphical demonstration of the relation between the new optimized coupling parameters and the cumulative probability is presented in Figure \ref{fig:optimized_cdf}.

	\section{Molecular Dynamics Simulations}\label{mds}

	Using the parameters of Table~\ref{tbl:parameters}, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations to obtain samples of potential energies at each expanded ensemble. The software package used to perform the simulations was LAMMPS \cite{lammps}. As required by the coarse-grained model, molecules with more than one segment were treated as rigid bodies. For simulating rigid bodies at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, the algorithm implemented in LAMMPS is that of Kamberaj \textit{et al}. \cite{kamberaj}, in which the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are handled separately by independent Nos\'{e}-Hoover chain thermostats \cite{PhysRevA.31.1695}. All simulations were executed with a time step size of 2~fs, with damping time parameters of 0.2~ps and 2~ps for the thermostats and the barostat, respectively. The potential cutoff distance was set to 20~$\text{\AA}$ \cite{muller2017}, with a neighbor list skin of 2~$\text{\AA}$. The initial configurations of the solvated systems were generated using Playmol \cite{playmol}, which integrates the Packmol package \cite{packmol} with LAMMPS \cite{lammps}. For the binary mixtures, one molecule of solute and a varying number of solvent molecules - 700 of toluene, 700 of octanol, 1024 of hexane, or 3000 of water - were randomly added to a cubic box. In addition to the systems with pure substances acting as solvents, we performed simulations to study the solvation of phenanthrene in a mixture of toluene and carbon dioxide with different weight fractions of \ce{CO_2} ($w_\text{\ce{CO_2}}$). The system consisted of one molecule of phenanthrene for all the cases and 123 molecules of \ce{CO_2} and 618 molecules of toluene ($w_\text{\ce{CO_2}} = 0.087$); 166 molecules of \ce{CO_2} and 589 molecules of toluene ($w_\text{\ce{CO_2}} = 0.119$); 232 molecules of \ce{CO_2} and 545 molecules of toluene ($w_\text{\ce{CO_2}} = 0.169)$; 380 molecules of \ce{CO_2} and 446 molecules of toluene ($w_\text{\ce{CO_2}} = 0.289$).

	All simulations were performed at constant temperature and pressure values of 298 K and 1 bar, respectively, except the ones for systems containing carbon dioxide. These ones were performed at the temperature of 298 K and at the experimental bubble-point pressure reported in Ref.~\cite{co2toliq} for each considered liquid-phase composition. For all simulations, the initial box was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble for 2~ns with the solute molecule totally coupled to the system (i.e. $\lambda = 1$), and the final configurations were used as the initial conditions for the expanded ensemble simulations. These were carried out with a new LAMMPS package for expanded ensemble simulations developed by our research group, available at \url{https://github.com/atoms-ufrj/USER-ALCHEMICAL}.

	During the expanded ensemble simulations, the sampling of a new alchemical state was tried at every 10 MD steps. To define the optimal values of $\lambda$ and $\eta$ corresponding to each state, relatively large trial simulations, having around 9 ns of production time, were carried out in order to ensure an adequate sampling of the intermediate states. In the first simulation, we chose a group of 15 equally-spaced $\lambda$ values, and we either set all $\eta$ values to zero or assigned values previously found for similar solute-solvent pairs. The subsequent $\eta$ sets were estimated with the flat-histogram approach expressed by Eq.~\eqref{eqn:weight}. We then performed another trial simulation with the new weights. The results of this simulation were used to optimize the $\lambda$ staging such as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:expanded ensemble}. The $\eta$ values corresponding to the newest $\lambda$ staging were interpolated linearly from the free energy differences. With the final values of $\eta$ and $\lambda$ defined for each mixture, larger simulations with a production time of 20 ns were carried out.

	Since the employed force field does not explicitly includes point charges in the molecular segments, the only contribution to the total potential energy of the inserted solute molecule is due to the softcore potential of Eq.~\eqref{eq:miesoftcore}. The post-processing method used to effectively calculate free-energy differences with the potential energies obtained from the expanded ensemble simulations was the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method \cite{mbar}. A software developed by Klimovich \textit{et al}. \cite{klimovich} for alchemical calculation analysis was used to obtain the values of $\Delta G_\text{solv}$ with MBAR and to assess the quality of the results.

	After the first estimations, we realized that the binary interaction parameter of Eq.~\eqref{eqn:epsmix} was necessary for systems having water as a solvent. Hence, we estimated $k_{ij}$ for these pairs only (for all the other pairs, we have set $k_{ij}$ to zero). The estimation was done by performing trial expanded ensemble simulations with three distinct values of $k_{ij}$, as suggested by Ervik \textit{et al}. \cite{ervik20162}. With the values of $\Delta G_\text{solv}$ obtained from these simulations, we carried out a linear fit and comparison to experimental data \cite{P29900000291, doi:10.1021/ct050097l} in order to obtain the refined value of the parameter. We used this strategy because the estimation of $k_{ij}$ using a top-down approach with the SAFT-VR Mie EoS gave poor results for the hydration free energies.

	\subsection{Solvation free energies in non-aqueous solvents}
	\label{sec:non-aqueous}

	Our primary intention with this study is to assess the capability of the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field to represent solvation free energies. Hence, we chose benchmark solutes used in the literature (benzene, propane) and aromatic solutes (benzene, pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene), and, for the solvents, we picked non-polar (hexane), aromatic (toluene), and hydrogen bonding (1-octanol, water) substances. The solvation free energy simulations for the pairs chosen were carried out with binary interaction parameters equal to zero since these parameters were not necessary according to our preliminary studies. Since the force field does not account for charges, we only calculated the Mie contribution (Eq.~\eqref{eq:miesoftcore}) to the solvation free energy. A total of 15 to 18 $\lambda 's$, depending on the solute-solvent pairs, and their respective $\eta 's$ were estimated as described in the previous sections. The simulations carried out using these optimized weights deviated from the flat-histogram requirement of equal number visits by an average of 5\% for all of the pairs solvent+solute. The final $\lambda$ set for all the pairs was found using the cumulative probability distribution (Eq. \eqref{eqn:cumfun}). For the hexane(solvent)+benzene(solute) pair, the probability distribution  can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:optimized_cdf}. From now on we are going to use the terminology solvent+solute. The optimized values of $\lambda$ and $\eta$ for this pair and all the other pairs are exposed in Tables \ref{tbl:lambdahex} to \ref{tbl:lambdaco2}, available in the Appendix. By observing the coupling parameters found for all the pairs, we can see that they are concentrated on the region with a steeper slope as it is expected in this method. After the expanded ensemble simulations with the optimized intermediate states and weights, we calculated the solvation free energies with MBAR. The results obtained and the absolute deviations to experimental data \cite{doi:10.1021/ci034120c} are available  in Table~\ref{tbl:solv1}. The numerical values for solvation free energies in hexane had overall smaller absolute deviations from experimental data than the deviations in the other solvents. Additionally, this force field presented better results for the pair hexane+benzene than the TraPPE force field (- 4.35  $\pm$ 0.05 kcal/mol) \cite{garrido2011} and the ELBA coarse-grained force field  (-2.92 $\pm$ 0.01 kcal/mol) \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00963}. It is also important to point out that the solvation free energies with these force fields were obtained with thermodynamic integration, which is different from the method used here. TraPPE is a force field parametrized with fluid-phase equilibria data that uses the Lennard-Jones potential to describe the non-bonded interactions. In the cited paper, they used the united-atom description of the TraPPE force field for the alkyl group, the all-atom description for the polar groups and the explicit-hydrogen approach for the aromatic groups. In the explicit-hydrogen approach, the interaction sites for all hydrogen atoms, some lone pair electrons, and bond centers are accounted for \cite{doi:10.1021/jp073586l}. In turn, the ELBA force field is a coarse-grained model that comprises six independent parameters. This force field models three carbons as one Lennard-Jones site and one water molecule as a single Lennard Jones site with a point-dipole. We also present the solvation free energies corresponding to each alchemical state ($\lambda$) for all the pairs studied here in Figures \ref{fig:hex} to \ref{fig:tol}. Specifically observing the solvation free energy in hexane (Fig.~\ref{fig:hex}), we can see the effect of the molecule's size on the entropic region of the free energy curve. This region corresponds to the first values of $\lambda$ where the cavity required for the insertion of the solute is formed.

    The solvation free energies of propane and phenanthrene in 1-octanol lied in the desired deviation range of 1-2 kcal/mol \cite{doimobley}. For propane, the observed deviation in solvation free energies was much smaller when compared to the other solutes, which can be attributed to the non-polarity of propane and its smoother free energy curve, presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:oct}. Such solvation free energy of propane in 1-octanol also had a smaller deviation than the prediction of the ELBA force field (-0.92 $\pm$ 0.01) \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00963}. The absolute deviation of the solvation free energy computed for anthracene in 1-octanol is much higher than the one calculated for phenanthrene in 1-octanol. The anthracene and phenanthrene molecules have the same geometry (Fig.~\ref{fig:fen5}) in the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model, although anthracene is a linear molecule and phenanthrene is not, and also similar physical properties. Hence, this high deviation of the solvation free energy of anthracene in 1-octanol may indicate a problem in the geometry chosen for anthracene in the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field and the importance of the geometry in modeling the molecules with this force field.   
	
	The results also indicate a reasonable capability of the force field for predicting the solvation free energies of polyaromatic solutes in aromatic solvents. The influence of the molecular geometry on the solvation free energy curves was the same as the one observed for other solvents, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:tol}.  We also calculated the $\Delta G_{solv}$ for phenanthrene in pure toluene and in toluene+\ce{CO_2} mixtures. To the best of our knowledge, there are no available experimental data for these solvation free energies, but the previous results for phenanthrene in other solvents showed that the force field is adequate to describe the solvation phenomenon of phenanthrene in a pure aromatic solvent. Hence, we decided to carry out a qualitative study of the influence of \ce{CO_2} in the solvation free energies of phenanthrene in toluene in order to evaluate the description of this system with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field. The results for these sets are exposed in Table~\ref{tbl:solvco2}. The increase of the mass fraction of \ce{CO_2} in toluene caused a small effect on the solvation free energies in the range of weight fractions (0.087-0.289) studied in this dissertation. First, the $\Delta G_{solv}$ decreased with the increase of $w_\text{\ce{CO_2}}$ up to 0.119. After this, the effect was reversed, and carbon dioxide became an anti-solvent. Soroush \textit{et al}. \cite{SOROUSH2014405} reported that asphaltene precipitation occurs when carbon dioxide mass fractions became higher than 0.10 in the system asphaltene+toluene+carbon dioxide, which is in agreement with the anti-solvent effect of carbon dioxide observed in the values calculated here. Although we noticed the anti-solvent effect, the differences observed are pretty small. These minor differences may indicate that the effect of \ce{CO_2} is negligible in the solvation of phenanthrene in toluene when using the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field to model the molecules. Nevertheless, more studies need to be done to make a safe assertion about it. It is also worth remarking that this is a qualitative study due to the lack of experimental data. Overall, the methodology proposed by the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field was satisfactory in predicting the solvation free energies of the pairs solvent-solute studied here.

	\subsection{Hydration free energies}
	
	Water is a solvent extensively used in experimental and computational studies. Because of this importance and the fact that water has unique properties, such as density maximum at 277 K and increased diffusivity upon compression, developing an accurate computational model for water is an ongoing quest \cite{hadley2012}. Hence, we also calculated the solvation free energies in water (hydration free energies) with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field. With these calculations, we intend to verify if this coarse-grained model would represent the water molecule correctly and would be a good alternative to decrease the computational cost of solvation studies with asphaltene models. The simulations with water as a solvent were carried out using widely studied solutes (propane) and aromatic solutes (benzene, toluene, and phenanthrene) with a set of fifteen intermediate states.  We obtained these sets of $\lambda$ and $\eta$ with the same methodology used to acquire the sets for the solvation free energies with non-aqueous solvents, and they are exposed in Table~\ref{tbl:lambdawater}, available in the Appendix. At first in our simulations, the binary interaction parameters of all aqueous mixtures were set to zero, but preliminary results for hydration free energies, displayed in Table~\ref{tbl:solv2},  exhibited a high deviation from experimental data \cite{P29900000291, doi:10.1021/ct050097l}. With these results, the need for binary interaction parameters became clear. First, we estimated $k_{ij}$ with the SAFT-VR Mie EoS and experimental vapor pressure data, but this strategy also provided results that had high absolute deviations from the experimental data. Therefore, we used the approach of estimating $k_{ij}$ with the output from solvation free energy calculations with molecular dynamics, as described in the last paragraph of Section \ref{mds}.  We initially found individual values for the interaction parameter of each pair, but, since the parameters for aromatic solutes were very similar (0.148, 0.162, 0.152), we averaged these values. By doing that,  we obtained a general parameter for the water+aromatic pairs, which is exposed in Table~\ref{tbl:kij}. Also in this table, we display the binary interaction parameter for the pair water+propane. 
	
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\caption{Binary interaction parameters employed.}
		\label{tbl:kij}
		\begin{tabular}{cc}
			\hline\hline
			Pair              & $k_{ij}$ \\ \hline
			water+propane  & 0.067    \\
			water+aromatic & 0.154    \\ \hline\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	The relatively large $k_{ij}$ value of the interaction between aromatic solutes and water can be related to the lack of a term in the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie to account for the interaction associated with a hydrogen bond substance. Actually, the SAFT-VR Mie has an association term \cite{lafitte2013}, but it was not incorporated in the force field. The SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model for water \cite{lobanova2016} has two different temperature-dependent sets of parameters. The parameters utilized in this work were those estimated with experimental interfacial tension data. Hence, we tested the only binary interaction parameter for water+toluene estimated with MD interfacial data available in the literature \cite{herdes2017}. Nevertheless, the result also had a high absolute deviation, and this parameter could not be transferred to the calculation of the solvation free energy of toluene in water. 
	
	These issues faced by SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model can also be related to the problems of modeling water with a coarse-grained force field. One of the main difficulties is the choice of which water molecules are going to be represented by which specific beads since water molecules move independently and interact by non-bonded interactions \cite{hadley2010,hadley2012}. The  SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie water considers that one water molecule corresponds to one bead. This strategy only saves a small amount of simulation time, but it can predict properties at physiological temperatures unlike other more aggressive models such as the MARTINI, which considers that one bead represents various water molecules. In light of all these problems related to modeling the water molecule, the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field appears to be a good alternative when working close to room temperatures, but the necessity of additional parameters estimated with molecular simulation indicates severe flaws in the methodology. This estimation of the binary parameter increased significantly the simulation time required to calculate the hydration free energies, since we had to carry out three additional simulations for every pair water-solute and then three additional simulations for the three water+aromatic solutes in order to test the averaged binary interaction parameter. If these simulations are necessary for every time a new mixture with water is going to be studied with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field, the use of this model can become impractical.  With this idea in mind, a useful investigation to be made is to check how much other pairs of water+aromatic solute can be modeled using the binary interaction parameter estimated here. Using these binary interaction parameters calculated with data from molecular dynamics, we then obtained the final hydration free energies presented in Table~\ref{tbl:solv2}.

	Hydration free energies calculated using the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field with $k_{ij} \neq 0$ had low absolute deviations from the experimental data, as expected since the parameters were adjusted to fit these experimental data. Hydration free energies have also been calculated for the pairs studied here by Genheden \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00963} with the ELBA force field and by Mobley and Guthrie \cite{PMID:24928188} with the GAFF force field for the solutes and with the TIP3P model for water. The GAFF (General Amber Force Field) force field is an all-atom model that consists of bonded and non-bonded parameters and is suitable for the study of a significant number of molecules. In turn, the TIP3P model considers that water is a rigid monomer represented by three interacting sites with non-bonded interactions and Coulombic interactions \cite{doi:10.1063/1.445869}. Both the GAFF and the TIP3P models use the Lennard-Jones potential to calculate the non-bonded interactions.
	
	Comparing the three aforementioned force fields, the root mean square error (RMSE) of all the pairs tested with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model was  0.24, the RMSE for hydration free energies obtained with the GAFF force field was 0.73, and that for the ELBA coarse-grained force field was 0.44. The difference in between the results of GAFF (-5.26$\pm$0.03) and SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie (-3.47 $\pm$ 0.02) force fields is significantly high for phenanthrene, hence the coarse-grained force field with a binary parameter is preferred if the application requires a high level of accuracy. The results also indicated that the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model with the binary interaction parameter performed better than the ELBA force field in modeling the solvation phenomenon of the pairs studied in this work, but performed worse with the binary parameter set to zero. This difference in performance occurred despite the fact that both the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie and ELBA models have the same level of coarse-graining for the solvent (one bead represents one water molecule). Therefore, the choice between the two coarse-grained models is dependent on the availability and transferability of binary interaction parameters of the Mie Model. We also present, for the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field, the hydration free energy profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig:water}. Bigger molecules had steeper free energy profiles, as it was for the solvation free energy study in other solvents. We also observe that the hydration free energy for the first non-zero $\lambda$ is negative for benzene and toluene when a positive value is expected since free energy is required for cavity formation in the solvent for the insertion of the solute. This anomaly can be caused by the fact that the exponential parameters in the Mie potential compensate for cavity formation.

	The results found here for both the solvation free energies and hydration free energies fulfilled the intentions of this dissertation. We assessed the prediction capability of the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field and provided satisfactory solvation free energy estimates of PAHs using a coarse-grained force field. In addition to that, we found flaws in the methodology used by the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field to model the water molecule. Hence, these shortcomings of this model can now be addressed, and the force field can even be improved by using other mixing rules to avoid the use of a binary parameter or, even, using hydration free energy estimates in the parameterization of water. These results also encourage us to calculate solvation free energies of more complex molecules mimicking asphaltenes in non-aqueous solvents in future studies.  
	
	\section{Conclusions}
	This study consisted in the calculation of solvation free energies of aromatic solutes in different solvents by using the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie coarse-grained force field. Solvation free energy studies are mostly done using water as a solvent and with all-atom force fields based on the Lennard-Jones potential. Therefore, with this study, we were able to provide data about the capability of a coarse-grained force field based on the Mie potential in calculating solvation free energies. Additionally, the solvation free energy estimations carried out here can help improve the SAFT-$\gamma$  Mie force field since these calculations are helpful in identifying errors and shortcomings in the modeling process. The SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie uses the SAFT-VR Mie EoS in its parameterization, which results in a relatively straightforward top-down method of obtaining parameters. Following this strategy, the phenanthrene parameters, which were not available in the original database of this force field, were obtained using vapor pressure data.
	
	To perform our expanded ensemble simulations, we optimized the coupling parameters and their respective simulation weights. The resulting potential energies from the expanded ensemble simulations then served as input to estimate solvation free energies with the MBAR method. The results for non-aqueous solvents had absolute deviations from the experimental data of less than 2.0 kcal/mol, except for the pair 1-octanol+anthracene. We also observed the geometry effect on the free energy curves - larger molecules had steeper curves and more substantial absolute deviations. The influence of carbon dioxide on the solvation free energy of phenanthrene in toluene was found to be negligible according to the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field. Hydration free energy calculations with the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie model required the use of relatively large values of $k_{ij}$ to produce satisfactory results. We chose to estimate the parameter with the output from molecular dynamics data since the strategy of using the SAFT-VR Mie EoS provided high absolute deviations from the experimental data. This necessity of one additional parameter probably happens due to the lack of a term to account for the hydrogen bond in the EoS on which this force field is based and due to problems associated with the coarse-graining of water molecules. The results obtained with $k_{ij}$ estimated with MD output were satisfactory, the absolute deviations from the experimental data found were smaller than the ones for the GAFF and ELBA force fields.
	Overall, the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field proved to be a suitable model to represent the solvation phenomenon of non-aqueous solvents. It correctly described solvation free energies of solutes mimicking asphaltenes dissolved in hexane, toluene, 1-octanol. However, the calculation of hydration free energies required the use of a binary interaction parameter estimated with MD output, which increased the simulation time significantly. This fact evidenced flaws in the methodology used by the SAFT-$\gamma$ force field and raised questions about the feasibility of this model for hydration free energy calculations. Nevertheless, the SAFT-$\gamma$ Mie force field for water used here does not predict freezing at room temperature as other force fields do, which is essential for our hydration free energy calculations.  Therefore, it would be relevant to test if the binary interaction parameter for our aromatic solutes estimated here can be used in hydration free energy calculations of other aromatic solutes.
